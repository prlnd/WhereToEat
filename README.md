# WhereToEat
This is an Android application written in Kotlin programming language for my university's exam project. We can browse restaurants from various different countries and cities, using a [third party API](https://ratpark-api.imok.space). I used modern libraries and components, supports both remote and local data sources, handles no internet connection, and stores or caches the data localy to local database when it's needed. We can add restaurants to favorites, view their details and their position on the map.
